  bio: "Passionate full stack web developer skilled in creating responsive, user-friendly web applications using the MERN stack.",
  longBio: `I'm a full stack web developer with experience building modern web applications. I specialize in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and have extensive experience with building RESTful APIs, managing application state, designing responsive UIs, and optimizing performance across the stack.

My journey in web development began when I built my first website for a local business while still in college. Since then, I've worked with startups and established companies to deliver seamless, end-to-end solutions that drive real business value.

I'm passionate about writing clean, maintainable code, building accessible and scalable applications, and keeping up with the latest in full stack development. When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me hiking, reading tech blogs, or contributing to open-source projects.`,
